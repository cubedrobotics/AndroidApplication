MonitorBot is a robot designed to autonomously patrol your house while you're not home.
It not only streams video to your phone, but it also has a thermal camera to allow the user to check for leaks inside walls as well
as view if their doors are leaking or their refrigerator is left open.  All these features will be available from anywhere in the world
through an encrypted VPN tunnel

Current Progress:
The robot hosts a local internet server that is connected to by the android application.  The user can view the video feed from the phone
as well as drive the robot around while in close proximity to it.
There is also code for a server that will allow the robot to be accessed from anywhere, but this is currently not implemented
